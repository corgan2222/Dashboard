# Bugs and Todo

- Show Icons even for non https links. ATM, if a link for a frame is not https, the icon is not shown
- Show Toogle Icons for each Frame to toogle

### Changes to frames:
- allow loading no http content into https sites ( --disable-web-security --allow-running-insecure-content )
- show content in fullframe (camera stream image) - i can provide css/html for that
- reload a frame after time (from settings), like if hiding and showing frame content
need this, because of massive ram increase after time on the grafana frame
- Frame Settings for each frame for the changes above:
- fix the settings window, atm its breaks if two entrys has the same url/name
- Checkbox to allow loading http content into https
- Checkbox to show frame content fullframe
- Refresh frame each XX minutes to prevent buffer overflow or similare technic
